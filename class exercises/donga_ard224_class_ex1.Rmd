## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(magrittr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
gapminder_subset <- subset(gapminder, country %in% c("Germany", "France"))
```

```{r}
gapminder_subset <- gapminder %>%
  subset(country %in% c("Germany", "France")) %>% 
  select(country, year, gdpPercap)
```

```{r}
# pivot the gapminder_subset data frame to wide format
gapminder_wide <- pivot_wider(gapminder_subset, names_from = "year", values_from = "gdpPercap")

# print the resulting data frame
gapminder_wide
```

```{r}
gapminder_wide <- pivot_wider(gapminder_subset, names_from = "year", values_from = "gdpPercap")

# store the resulting data frame in gapminder_wide
gapminder_wide <- as.data.frame(gapminder_wide)
```

```{r}
gapminder_long <- pivot_longer(gapminder_wide, cols = -country, names_to = "year", values_to = "gdpPercap")

# print the resulting data frame
gapminder_long
```
